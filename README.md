# Keylogger
A python based keylogger using Pynput Library.

I have made a python based Keylogger which can be used for tracking the keyboard actions.
Pynput is the library used here.
The srcipt only collects the character key logs and "Shift", "Backspace" and "Space" keys.
It does not collect any other key logs.
